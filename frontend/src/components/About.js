                        <p>I consider myself as a full stack web developer with a little bit more experience in the back end. I enjoy working on projects where I can be part of a team, brainstorm and see our ideas become reality.</p>
                        <p><strong>What would I bring to a role working as a developer?</strong></p>
                        <p>I will bring a set of technical skills, experience plus good energy that will add value to your company. I might feel challenged many timesâ€¦ but guess what... that's what I like! I will always find solutions to problems since I enjoy learning new things every day.</p>
